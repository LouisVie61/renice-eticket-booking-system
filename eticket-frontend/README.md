# 🎓 Teaching Support Project – UET CodeCamp

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

> 🏫 **Note:** This project is developed as part of the **UET CodeCamp** program – an educational training initiative organized by the **University of Engineering and Technology (UET) – Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU)**.

## 🧑‍🏫 Purpose

* Designed to support teaching and hands-on learning in the **UET CodeCamp** curriculum.
* Enables students to practice modern web development using **Next.js**, **React**, and related technologies.
* Serves as a base for educational exercises, project-based learning, and real-world simulations.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
